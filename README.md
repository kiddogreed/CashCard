# CashCard
The @JsonTest annotation marks the CashCardJsonTest as a test class which uses the Jackson framework (which is included as part of Spring). This provides extensive JSON testing and parsing support. It also establishes all the related behavior to test JSON objects.

JacksonTester is a convenience wrapper to the Jackson JSON parsing library. It handles serialization and deserialization of JSON objects.
@Autowired is an annotation that directs Spring to create an object of the requested type.
